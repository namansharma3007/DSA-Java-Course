class:
    -> is names group of properties and functions
    -> final: this keyword will prevent the original data to be modified

static:
    -> object that is common to everyone
    -> they are not dependent on object i.e. they can be accessed even without declaring any object. We can directly access it by using class name
    -> static variable is accessed by class name and not by using "this" [For example refer: /OOPS/staticExample/Human.java]
