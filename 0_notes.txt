a) Binary Number
    Mostly sorted array
    Square root

    #IMP
    /* Ceiling of a no */
    When we need to return the no greater than or equal to the given no. The greater no should also be present in the list. Just return start in place of -1.

    /* Floor of a no */
    Would be same as the above one just return end in place of -1.

b) Format a string
    %c - Character
    %d - Decimal number (base 10)
    %e - Exponential floating-point number
    %f - Floating-point number
    %i - Integer (base 10)
    %o - Octal number (base 8)
    %s - String
    %u - Unsigned decimal (integer) number
    %x - Hexadecimal number (base 16)
    %t - Date/time
    %n - Newline

c) Patterns
    # if you are given numbers try not to use 0 as inintial value in loop => use "i=1"
    Step 1 - run outer for loop for the no of lines
    Step 2 - how may columns are there with each row 
    Step 3 - what do you need to print
